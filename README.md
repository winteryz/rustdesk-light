`rust-desk-light` is a lightweight Rust remote assistance toolkit with a GUI operator console, a CLI relay server, GUI and CLI endpoint clients, and a compact binary protocol. It supports device discovery, command execution, remote terminal, file transfer, remote desktop, camera preview, audio listen, and duplex voice chat across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

> Intended for authorized remote assistance, lab administration, and development/testing environments. Current transport is not end-to-end encrypted; use trusted networks, VPNs, or other network-level protection for sensitive deployments.

## Overview

| Binary | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rdl-admin-gui` | GUI | Operator console for online clients, command dispatch, live control, file transfer, and remote terminals. |
| `rdl-server-cli` | CLI | Relay server for peer registration, session tokens, presence, routing, and UDP audio relay. |
| `rdl-client-gui` | GUI | Full endpoint client with status window, live control, media capture, and terminal fallback. |
| `rdl-client-cli` | CLI | Terminal-only endpoint client built without GUI/live-control dependencies. |

Linux desktop control targets X11 tools such as `maim`, ImageMagick `import`, and `xdotool`. macOS remote control needs Accessibility permission for the app that launches `rdl-client-gui`, and screen capture may need Screen Recording permission.

## Quick Start

Start the local development stack:

```sh
./scripts/start-dev.sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\start-dev.bat
```

Manual local run:

```sh
./target/debug/rdl-server-cli --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 5169
./target/debug/rdl-client-gui --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 5169
./target/debug/rdl-admin-gui --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 5169
```

Start the server first, then clients, then admin.

## Build

Requires Rust stable and Git.

```sh
rustup update stable
cargo check --workspace
cargo build --workspace
cargo build --workspace --release
```

Build the no-GUI client:

```sh
cargo build-client-cli --release
```

Individual build aliases:

```sh
cargo build-server-cli --release
cargo build-client-gui --release
cargo build-client-cli --release
cargo build-admin-gui --release
```

Debug binaries go to `target/debug`; release binaries go to `target/release`. Windows adds `.exe`.

## Configuration

Config files are created automatically on first run. Startup arguments override config files.

```sh
rdl-server-cli --config config/server.toml
rdl-client-gui --config config/client.toml
rdl-client-cli --config config/client.toml
rdl-admin-gui --config config/admin.toml
```

Useful environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `RDL_IP` | Default IP used by helper scripts. |
| `RDL_PORT` | Default port used by helper scripts. |
| `RDL_FORCE_TERMINAL` | Forces GUI binaries into terminal mode. |
| `RDL_GEOIP_DB` | Path to a MaxMind GeoLite2/GeoIP2 City database. |
| `RDL_BUILD_VERSION` | Overrides the displayed build version. |

## Capabilities

| Area | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Device operations | Online client list, search/filter, host metadata, heartbeat/reconnect, offline cleanup. |
| Remote management | File manager, directory transfer, remote terminal, process/window/startup/driver managers, registry snapshot, event log, active connections, performance monitor. |
| Live control | Remote desktop, mouse/keyboard input, camera preview, audio listen, duplex voice chat. |
| User interaction | Message box, system notification, text chat, open text in the platform editor. |
| System tools | Computer information, clipboard read/write, execute file, execute code, static commands, task creation, command presets. |

## Architecture

    Admin["rdl-admin-gui\nOperator console"]
    Server["rdl-server-cli\nPresence + routing + relay"]

    subgraph Clients["Managed endpoints"]
        Win["rdl-client-gui / rdl-client-cli\nWindows"]
        Linux["rdl-client-gui / rdl-client-cli\nLinux"]
        Mac["rdl-client-gui / rdl-client-cli\nmacOS"]
        More["rdl-client-gui / rdl-client-cli\n...more clients"]
    end

    Admin <-->|"operator sessions"| Server
    Server <-->|"managed connections"| Win
    Server <-->|"managed connections"| Linux
    Server <-->|"managed connections"| Mac
    Server <-->|"managed connections"| More
```

The server is intentionally thin. It authenticates registered peers with server-issued session tokens, keeps a presence table, and routes typed messages between admins and clients. Endpoint actions run on clients, not on the relay.

## Transport

The configured server address uses the same numeric port for TCP and UDP. If you run across machines, allow both protocols on that port.

| Capability | Direction | Transport | Message format |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Registration, session token, heartbeat, client list | Admin/Client <-> Server | TCP | `RDL1` framed binary messages |
| Commands, acknowledgements, command output, remote terminal | Admin -> Server -> Client, then results back | TCP | `Command`, `CommandAck`, `CommandOutput` |
| File manager and file transfer | Admin <-> Server <-> Client | TCP | `FileTransfer` messages |
| Remote desktop and camera preview | Client -> Server -> Admin | TCP | `VideoControl`, `VideoFrame`, `DesktopInput` |
| Audio listen and duplex voice chat | Admin/Client <-> Server | UDP | `RDU1` `pcm_s16le` packets |

Reliable work stays on framed TCP messages; interactive audio uses small low-latency UDP packets so voice does not queue behind bulk traffic.

## Client Map

The admin map uses a MaxMind GeoLite2/GeoIP2 City database when configured:

```sh
./target/release/rdl-server-cli --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 5169 --geoip-db /path/GeoLite2-City.mmdb
```

The startup scripts also auto-detect `third_party/geoip/GeoLite2-City.mmdb`. See [GeoLite2 City setup](docs/geolite2-city-setup.md).

## Smoke Test

The smoke flow uses terminal mode so shells and CI can drive the protocol:

```sh
./scripts/smoke-test.sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\smoke-test.bat
```

## Release Builds

Tagged releases are built by GitHub Actions from `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

Each release package contains:

```text
rdl-server-cli
rdl-client-gui
rdl-client-cli
rdl-admin-gui
README.md
```

`rdl-client-cli` is built without GUI dependencies for terminal-only deployments.

On macOS, clear quarantine metadata after extracting a downloaded archive if needed:

```sh
xattr -cr ./rdl-client-gui
xattr -cr ./rdl-admin-gui
xattr -cr ./rdl-server-cli
```

## Version Info

```sh
rdl-server-cli --version
rdl-client-gui --version
rdl-client-cli --version
rdl-admin-gui --version
```

Tagged builds use the git tag; local builds use the workspace version unless `RDL_BUILD_VERSION` is set.

## Project Notes

- The main transport is a custom versioned binary protocol with `RDL1` framed messages.
- Audio listen and voice chat use a separate `RDU1` packet format with stream ids, sequence numbers, capture timestamps, sample rate, channel count, and PCM payloads.
- Linux remote desktop testing details live in [Ubuntu X11 remote desktop testing](docs/ubuntu-x11-remote-desktop-testing.md).
- Current milestones and planned work live in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
